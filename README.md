## Description

Atlantis hotel Application is a website that allows costumers to reserve rooms or other servises of the hotel in easy steps. the website contains useful pages like the rooms page, which provides the viewers information about the rooms and suits in the hotel, and the reservation options they can choose from. another important page is the restaurant page, that allows residents to reserve a table in the restuarant or order a delivery to their hotel room. alongside about and contact us pages.

<br/>

## User Stories


- As a costumer, i want to view the options and photos of rooms, so that i choose what i like to reserve.
- As a costumer, i want to reserve a table in the restaurant online, so that i can sit and order when i arrive without waiting.
- As a resident, i want to contact the admins anytime, so i can ask questions and leave feedback.
- As a user, i want to have edit option on my reservations, so i can edit or cancel themanytime.

<br/>

## General Approach 

Based on the previous user-stories, the website was created for two main approaches, the first is to simplify the process of reservation for costumers, directly from the hotel's official website. so after the costumers register in the website, they will be able to choose a room and reserve it easily, alongside the different services the hotel offers like the restaurant.

<br/>

the second approach is to deliver an effecient, fast, and userfriendly website, with a pleasing interface that the costumers can be comfortable surfing it and making their reservations without the need of third-party websites.

<br/><br/>



## Technologies used :
* GitHub: server and tools.
* HTML & CSS: for the applicatoin's structure and design.
* java (Spring Boot & JSP): for effeciency and saving time.
* JavaScript: for dynamic responsive pages
* MySqli: for creating the databases needed in the application.
* Hibernate: for java mapping.
* JDBC, AWC, IDC.

<br/><br/>

## Planning

The initial plan was a hotel application with options to reserve rooms and free breakfast as an additional service, the the idea developed to many options:

1. User can choose between rooms or suites instead of picking from one type of rooms.
2. Free breakfast replaced with all day restaurant.
3. User can reserve, edit , or cancel any reservation.
4. Feedback through contact us page.

<br/>
plan was successfully applied to the application.

<br/><br/>

## Problems

- User profile: <br/>
It was planned to be viewed as a drop down button, but it was replaced with a profile page instead.
- Query to find costumer by phone number, *unsolved*.
- Authentication Security contact folder, *unsolved*.
